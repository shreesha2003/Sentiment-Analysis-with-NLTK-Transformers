# Sentiment-Analysis-with-NLTK-Transformers

You're absolutely right ‚Äî NLTK and Transformers are both central to this project, and the README should explicitly mention them, especially in the **Introduction**, **Installation**, and **Workflow** sections. Here's an updated version of the `README.md` with proper emphasis on `nltk` and `transformers`.

# üìä Sentiment Analysis in Python

This repository provides a complete walkthrough of performing sentiment analysis on the [Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews?resource=download) using both **rule-based NLP (NLTK VADER)** and **deep learning (Hugging Face Transformers - RoBERTa)**. It includes data exploration, visualization, model comparison, and hands-on example reviews.

## üìÅ Dataset

We use the **Amazon Fine Food Reviews** dataset, which contains over 500,000 reviews with text and numeric ratings.

## üß∞ Technologies Used

* **Python** 3.8+
* **Pandas** and **Matplotlib/Seaborn** for data processing and visualization
* **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit for basic NLP and the VADER sentiment analyzer
* **Hugging Face Transformers**: For using pretrained RoBERTa models
* **Scikit-learn**: For evaluation and basic utility functions

## üìà Results and Comparison

| Model   | Type                       | Pros                                    | Cons                                 |
| ------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| VADER   | Rule-based (NLTK)          | Fast, interpretable, no training needed | Less accurate for complex/long texts |
| RoBERTa | Transformer (Hugging Face) | High accuracy, context-aware            | Slower, requires GPU for speed       |

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project gives a full-stack overview of sentiment analysis using classical NLP and state-of-the-art transformers. You‚Äôll see the trade-offs between speed and accuracy and how to interpret results from both rule-based and ML models.
